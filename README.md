# Bellybutton_Biodiversity
This project used JacaScript and HTML components to read and work with a bacterial data JSON file. Specifically, used Plotly to graph and visualize the data. 

## Project Summary 
This project used Plotly to visualize the data in two ways: bar and bubble chart. The JSON data file containted bacteria species names, labels, and ID numbers already in sequential order.The bar chart shows the top ten bacterial species per the id of the subject. The slice function was used to sort the bacteria into top 10 which was then visualized. The bubble chart was a general distribution that showed all the data variables plotted and used in their own way to create the graph. Overall, this project used Javascript functions heavily to modify the data and Plotly was used to visualize the data similar to Matplotlib. The difference, this time, is that everything was placed on a webpage using HTML which can be deployed and be viewed by a broader audience.
